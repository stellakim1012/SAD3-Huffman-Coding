ELSA
Every inch of me is trembling
But not from the cold
Something is familiar
Like a dream I can reach
But not quite hold

I can sense you there
Like a friend I've always known
I'm arriving
And it feels like I am home

I have always been a fortress
Cold secrets deep inside
You have secrets too
But you don't have to hide

Show yourself
I'm dying to meet you
Show yourself
It's your turn

Are you the one I've been looking for all of my life?!
Show yourself!
I'm ready to learn...

Ah-ah-ah-ah

THE VOICE
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

ELSA
I've never felt it so certain
All my life I've been torn
But I'm here for a reason
Could it be the reason I was born?

I have always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day
Are you the way
I finally find out why!!?

Show yourself!
I'm no longer trembling!

Here I am
I've come so far!
You are the answer I've waited for all of my life!
Oh, show yourself
Let me see who you are...

Come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more!

Oh, come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more!
