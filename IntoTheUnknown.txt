Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ahh--ah-ah
I can hear you
But I won't.
Some look for trouble
While others don't.
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers
Which I wish would go away...
Oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ahh--ah-ah
You're not a voice.
You're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you (which I don't)
I'm spoken for, I fear.
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls.
I've had my adventure
I don't need something new!
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
Into the unknown...
Into the unknown...
Into the unknown!
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ahh--ah-ah
What do you want?
'Cause you've been keeping me awake.
Are you here to distract me
So I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?
Everyday's a little harder as I feel my power grow!
Don't you know there's a part of me that longs to go...
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown!
Into the unknown!!
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah- ah
Ah-ah-ah- ah
Ah-ah-ah- ah
Ah-ah-ah- ah!
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone!
Ah- ah-
How do I follow you
Into the unknown?
Ah-ah-ah!
